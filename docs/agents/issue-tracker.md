# Issue tracker: Local Markdown

Issues and specs for this repo live as Markdown files in `.scratch/`.

## Conventions

- One feature per directory: `.scratch/<feature-slug>/`.
- The spec is `.scratch/<feature-slug>/spec.md`.
- Implementation issues are one file per ticket at `.scratch/<feature-slug>/issues/<NN>-<slug>.md`, numbered from `01`; never create a combined ticket file.
- Triage state is recorded as a `Status:` line near the top of each issue file.
- Comments and conversation history append to the bottom of the file under a `## Comments` heading.

## Publishing

When a skill says to publish to the issue tracker, create the appropriate file under `.scratch/<feature-slug>/`. When a skill says to fetch a ticket, read the referenced file.
